An array  of n integers with two disjoint sets A and B are created here.
If an element in array belongs to set A, you add 1 to your happy value.
If an element in array belongs to set B, you add (-1) to your happy value.

##Test case 1:
    - (stdin)i/p -      3 2
                        1 5 3
                        3 1
                        5 7
    - (stdout)o/p -     1
    - Expected output - 1
Expected output is same as output received from code.

##Test case 2:
    - (stdin)i/p -      5 5
                        1 2 3 4 5
                        1 3 5 7 9
                        2 4 6 8 10
    - (stdout)o/p -     1
    - Expected output - 1
Expected output is same as output received from code.

##Test case 3:
    - (stdin)i/p -      5 5

    - (stdout)o/p -     1
    - Expected output - 1
Expected output is same as output received from code.
