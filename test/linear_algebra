You are given a square matrix (say A) with dimensions N*N.
Task is to find the determinant.
Note : Round the determinant value to 2 decimal places.

##Test case 1:
    - (stdin)i/p -      2
                        1.1 1.1
                        1.1 1.1
    - (stdout)o/p -     0.0
    - Expected output - 0.0
Expected output is same as output received from code.

##Test case 2:
    - (stdin)i/p -      2
                        1.1 1.1
                        1.1 1.2
    - (stdout)o/p -     0.11
    - Expected output - 0.11
Expected output is same as output received from code.

##Test case 3:
    - (stdin)i/p -      3
                        1 2 3
                        4 5 6
                        1 2 1
    - (stdout)o/p -     6.0
    - Expected output - 6.0
Expected output is same as output received from code.
