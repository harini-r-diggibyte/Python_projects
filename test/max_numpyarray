You are given a 2 dimensional array N*M.
Task is to perform the min function over axis 1 and then find max of that.

##Test case 1:
    - (stdin)i/p -      4 2
                        2 5
                        3 7
                        1 3
                        4 0
    - (stdout)o/p -     3
    - Expected output - 3
Expected output is same as output received from code.

##Test case 2:
    - (stdin)i/p -      4 2
                        2 5
                        8 7
                        1 4
                        4 0
    - (stdout)o/p -     7
    - Expected output - 7
Expected output is same as output received from code.

##Test case 3:
    - (stdin)i/p -      3 2
                        2 5
                        1 4
                        4 0
    - (stdout)o/p -     2
    - Expected output - 2
Expected output is same as output received from code.
